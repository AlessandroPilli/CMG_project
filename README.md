# CMG_project

This project involves an analysis of SGB4964, a species-level genome bin isolated from stool samples, for which no known references are available. The work was carried out by Filippo Mirolo, Vittoria Ossanna, and myself, with each of us contributing equally to the development of the project. In this repository, you will find the [report]() and [scripts](./scripts) that we produced to make this project possible.
